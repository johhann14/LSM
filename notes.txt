problems from readout ? try another readout
problems from liquid ? 
problems from the input encoding ?
problems from the input layer ?



===============

general pipeline of the liquid:
1) update the synapses (they deliver current to the postneurons)
2) liquid neurons recieve input curretn from the input layer
3) iteration of the neurons

we loop 

What I have so far: 

separation property seems ok
memory curve from 0.8 to flat 0.6 not ok

raw signal (T,)
->
rate encoding (T, n_input)
->
projection into the liquid via W_in (n_liquid, n_input)
-> X (T,n_liquid)
readout
-> train Wout via X to predict y



at first no noise to test 
skip inital transient

careful for the readout training if n_timesteps < n_liquid

maybe try without stp at first but need to find good parameters
